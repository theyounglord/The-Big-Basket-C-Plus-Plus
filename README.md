This repo is Developed to keep track of your learning status of C++ in accordance with [@Apna College - Youtube Channel<img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/RIWv8BDpQuEE713lzd/giphy.gif" width="100px">](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBwmMxybNva6P_5VmxjzwqA/featured)(Subscribe them if you are Indian and want to learn c++). Even though if you are not indian and want to keep track of learning experience of Programming in C++. This repo could be very useful to you guys. So Very Welcome <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> all of you guys to this repo. 
## <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/xUPGcqrPHgjS1bzhWU/giphy.gif" width="70px">Why you should use this repo?
Before starting this repo i was not able to keep myself consistent and motivated towards my learning journey so i decided why not make a checklist repo which can somehow provide me a sense of achievement and also keep track of my learning the programming with c++. So thats when i decided to make this repo.

It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

The next phase is about building logics on your own, so try as hard as possible to build or find the logics

behind the Programs on your `NoteBooks`first and then code on your systems. Also if anyone wants to edit this 

repo in his/her own way. you guys are free to do. Thank you .

```
In this phase we are going to solve some pattern problems which will help you to develop an idea that how should we build the logics behind the problem with our learned concepts.
This Phase require an important set of time of your's, so that when we move on to the next levels, we'll have an idea in mind that how should we'll build the logics behind the problem.
```
`Success is very uncofertable process, so make yourself comfertable with being uncomfertable.`

`In this level we are going to solve some pattern Problems starting with easy once to the complex ones.`

`Solve all the below questions using nested for Loop.`
- [ ] Program to print rectangle where user provides number of rows and columns / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#rectangle-pattern)
```cpp
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

```
- [ ] Program to print hollow rectangle where user provides number of rows and columns / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#hollow-rectangle-pattern)
```cpp
* * * *
*     *
*     *
*     *
* * * *
```
`
Hint:-
You have to print some spaces between the rectangle to make it hollow rectangle.
i.e You have to print spaces instaed of "*", similar to the above question  except in 1st row, last row, 1st column and last column.
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e half Pyramid using numbers```take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#half-pyramid-using-numbers-pattern)
```cpp
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```
`
Hint:-
In this Program we have to iterate all the elements of row from 1 to n.
So that Row number = Number of Columns.
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e Half Pyramid using numbers "0" & "1"```take variable n as, only input to the program /[Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#half-pyramid-using-numbers-0--1-pattern)
```cpp
1
0 1
1 0 1
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
```
`
Hint:-
This Program is very similar o the Half Pyramid using numbers Pattern.
But in this you just have to figure out that at which Position you should print "1" and vice versa for "0"
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e Floyd's Triangle```take variable n as, only input to the program /[Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#floyds-triangle-pattern)

```cpp
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* * 
*
```

`
Hint:-
In this Program we have to iterate all the elements of row from n to 1.
So that Row number = Number of Columns.

```
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e. half pyramid using after 180 degree rotaion using "*"``` take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#half-pyramid-using-after-180-degree-rotaion)
```cpp
        *
      * *
    * * *
  * * * *
* * * * *
```
`
Hint:- In this Program you have to figure print some space first and then you have to print pattern using "*".
Consider this Program as a rectangle pattern in which we have to print some spaces where the elements of column is less than equal to (n-i).
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e. rhombus using "*"``` take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#rhombus-pattern)

        * * * * *
      * * * * *
    * * * * *
  * * * * * 
* * * * *
```
`
Hint:-Consider this program as a rectangle after placing some spaces.
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e. Hollow rhombus using "*"``` take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#hollow-rhombus-pattern)

      *       *   
    *       *     
  *       *

`
Hint:-Consider this problem as a hollow rectangle with some spaces first.
`
- [ ] Print the given pattern w.r.t. variable n=5 ```i.e. Number Pattern``` take variable n as, only input to the program / [Solution](https://github.com/theyounglord/The-Big-Basket-C-Plus-Plus/blob/main/SOLUTION.md#number-pattern)
```cpp
    1
   1 2
  1 2 3
 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
`
Hint:-In this Program you have to print some spaces first as usual and then when you have to
print half Pyramid with an extra space after each element of the column to maintain the order and design of Pattern.
